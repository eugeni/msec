This is really basic stuff at the moment...

init-sh : 
	this is where all script / library to switch security level are,
	use init.sh only.

cron-sh : 
	Here are all security script that will be used in crontab.

src:
	C program for security check.

Note : i know my Makefile are dirty, 
		so if someone wish to clean them :-)


******************

All stuff are installed in /etc/security/msec/
use init.sh to change security level
