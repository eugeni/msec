******************

* level4/level5 : "services disabled" explanations :

- Some server aren't really considered as secure,
  these one, should for exemple be compiled from sources.
  server considered as secure are specified in /etc/security/msec/init-sh/server.4/5
  
  When enabling level4/5, all server which aren't considered as secure are
  disabled ( NOT uninstalled, just disabled ) user can reenable them using the
  chkconfig utility ( server will be launched at next boot ).
 
  In these level, we are also denying rpm to enable any server considered as insecure 
  ( off course rpm can install the server ).
  The user have the choise : chkconfig --add servername will enable the server.
  Or add the server in the secured server list







*** Future Release : ***
- Automatic tty locking ( unlock by passwd ) after X time of inactivity.
- In high security level, only user having access to group "sugrp" can use the su command.
